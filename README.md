## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub project for my website! This website will include more details about who I am, what I do, and what I want to learn more. Unfortunately, since this project is personal, it is **not open for contributions**.

This project was curated with the help of [HTML 5 Up!](https://html5up.net/) (awesome stuff!) and the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (super awesome stuff!). Feel free to take a look at the project.

## Contributing

As stated before, this project is not open for contributions. However, if there are any critical flaws that you've spotted and you'd like to help, feel free to create an issue. I don't have templates for issues, though.
